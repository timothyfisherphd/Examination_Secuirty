Description: To develop a GUI that recognizes a face and matches it to the
images GUI's database. The database will automatically check if the
matched faced from the live captured image is present in the database.
 
Assumptions: 
- User knows basic usage of a computers components (mouse, keyboard,
webcam, etc.)
- Must download the complete zip file and not edit the organization of the folders. 
- User has MATLAB2018a with Computer Vision toolbox, Image Acquisition
toolbox,  Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox and the 
correct video adapter for MATLAB installed. 

Usage:
1.) In MATLAB Command Window, type TestVerification to begin the program. 
2.) First select the student's name you are trying to verify. This will begin the training and set the matching to the student's folder. ( Go to step 5 if student name is not in drop down box.)
3.) Click the Verify ID then click Camera. Follow all the prompts in the message boxes and dialogue boxes.
4.  If matched, then in the right window you will have a matched image from the database. If not matched then you will have a red x. 
5.) If student is not in the database then go to Database menu option. Then click New Student to add a new folder to FaceDatabaseFolder. 
6.) Then add new student image by scrolling to Database then clicking New Student Picture to add a new student picture. Follow all the prompts.  
7.) Reset the program after you added the new pictures. 
8.) Redo steps 1 through 4. 
9.) Quit the program when you are done.

Notes: 
- If you have a windows or linux system then use need to change the .m files code
  to your respective adaptors.
- Change the / to \ when using windows!!!!
- Must install all the toolboxes/adaptors for this to fully function. 
- Keep the folder/file names consistent and keep the same structure as downloaded originally.
